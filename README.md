FileSystemProviders for java.nio introduced in Java 7. The binary code is only tested and compiled on Java 8.

It allows File system operation agnostic to the underlying implementation,
much like Apache VFS, but now in standard Java.

__NB:__ The project has moved in Maven Central.
This library was previously published with groupId `no.uis.nio` in Maven Central. Version 1.1.7 is the last version under this groupId.

Newer versions are published with groupId `no.maddin.niofs`.
